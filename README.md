Real Estate Landing Page - UW Coding Final Class Project - not for commercial use

Program instructions:

To correctly start the program, insert the Weather API key on line 132 ('WEATHER_API_KEY_HERE') of the RealEstateLangingPage.js file. Insert the Google API key on line 96 (src=url.key=GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE) of the index.html file. Once the keys are inserted, the program should be ready to run.

 This is a Real Estate Landing Page designed to capture customer information from a pay-per-click ad. Once the customer lands on the page, they would file in the "Get Your Home Value" form field. From there, an email would be sent to the real estate company and a realtor would reach out with a value (email on submit not yet completed/not graded). Once the form field is completed, validated, and submitted; the form is cleared and a message is presented to the customer.
